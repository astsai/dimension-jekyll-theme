Hi! I am studying immunology in clinical contexts such as surgery (primary hip arthroplasty (PHA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA)) and acute ischemic stroke under <a href="https://gaudillierelab.stanford.edu">Dr. Brice Gaudilliere</a> at Stanford School of Medicine. I am interested in utilizing the high-dimensionality of mass cytometry (CyTOF) to understand the modularity of the immune system in response to trauma. I completed my undergraduate studies in Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in Neurobiology at the University of California, Berkeley. My undergraduate thesis was on studying the population genetics of Hydromantes shastae with <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/wanglab/">Dr. Ian Wang</a> and <a href="ttp://www.guinwogan.com/">Dr. Guin Wogan</a>. 

High dimensional data requires advanced biocomputational power. I work closely with <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu/">Dr. Nima Aghaeepour</a>'s group to advance the two fields in parallel. 
Here is a graphic from <a href="https://stanleyn.github.io/">Dr. Natalie Stanley</a>'s newest algorithm, <b>VoPo</b>, which has the ability to agnostically cluster immune cells and identify novel populations of interest:

Currently, I am studying medicine at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine. My anticipated graduation is in 2022.
